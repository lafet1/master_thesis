I understand being a mod is thankless and you have a life your own, and there's probably a lot you do that I don't see. What I mean by *could*\\xa0is that there are problems that are in your hands (and I'll get to them in a minute) and there are a lot that are out of your hands that we all just have to deal with.\\n\\nI like your attempt in getting flairs and more voting on the threads. While I can't say in the voting, I can see the flairs just not working because it solves a problem this sub didn't have. (There might be more to it than that, but that's just IMO)\\n\\nAs for problems that I would love to see happen on this sub:\\n\\n* Personally I wouldn't just copying/pasting the rules from r/startups. That sub just seems so much more organized and mature. Maybe it's due to the other modding\\xa0or people just fed up with this sub, but what they're doing works and need more of.\\n\\n* My favorite part of this sub is the daily sub stickies. The problem about them though, is some aren't as effective as they should be nor are they enforce as well either. \\n\\n* Noob Money or Wantreprenuer Wednesday needs to be removed as they are too similar. One would like to see replace is a bartering thread where it's like marketplace tuesday,\\xa0but a way to get work without capital, but still be compensating.\\n\\n* I'm going to mention the enforcing of those sticky threads again, as you may know there's a lot\\xa0of self promoting going on. I get it, we want to\\xa0help others, but ulterior motives aren't cool.\\xa0\\n\\n* This is something that you can put in the sidebar as a lot of people would say is the biggest problem is the redundancy of questions that have been asked a lot. i.e.\\xa0What can a college kid do? How do I stop someone from stealing my idea? How do I make X amount of money in Y amount of days? What platform should my website be on? I suggest a FAQ for this sub that goes over all these questions so we can just copy/paste or refer to it.\\xa0\\n\\n* Another problem I see is a lot of people ask questions that are just too specific to be asked here. I.E. things that you should ask\\xa0r/legal_advice, r/web_design, r/Seo, r/graphic_design, etc. Sure a lot of us had to dabble in these areas regardless of our expertise due to lack of capitol and such. It's that I see a lot of blind leading the blind going on and I understand this one sounds too hard to enforce as the line between what's general enough for this sub is too blurred to say. I wouldn't be surprised if this one I just have to deal with.\\n\\n* Speaking of these questions a lot of these can be solved by googling it or just using the reddit\\xa0search bar. Granted I know that search bar is terrible, but it's something that we can all use regardless. I understand a lot of beginners feel so lost and would like more expert advice, but no one wants to do their marketing homework for them (or at least for free)\\n\\n* While I understand a lot of people like to give back to this community via free labor, I can't help to roll my eyes when we're all (trying to be) capitalists. I do feel we need to enforce that wonderful charity work should only be for non-profits. I don't mean to sound like a bad person, but steer away from taking advantage of people's generosity.\\xa0If this were to stay, at\\xa0least it should only be in thank you thursday.\\n\\n* One weekly sticky thread I would like to see is one for posting blogs. As you may know, they're easy to get out of hand because while some blogs are actually useful, but many just use it to boost their audience. As well it can be subjective to know is this thread worthy enough to deleted. Having a specific thread (in theory) should be a clearer acceptance.\\n\\n* I would\\xa0like accomplishments and lesson learned to be on saturday\\xa0while friday\\xa0to be a feedback friday. For y'know\\xa0feedback on everything.\\n\\n* Last but not least, I would love to see linkedin\\xa0flairs. Not only can this contain the self promoting, but it'll be easier to see who's blowing smoke when they're talking about their expertise. \\nWhile I like to see them mandatory, but I understand that can go against what makes reddit\\xa0unique.\\n\\nI hope this helps and makes this community better. I feel confident that this would promote original and engaging content - or at least it will stop veterans from rolling their eyes into their skulls.\\xa0\",\n",

I actually just realized today that might be the reason why the person she’s seeing isn’t her boyfriend because she might not want to deal with a long distance relationship.\\n\\nThank you so much for your insight about ENFP’s.

I do feel if she knew me, things would be different, as cliche as that sounds.\\n\\nI could see us being in two different stages in life. As she is about adventures and in the present while I’m so career focused and always planning for the future, y’know, being an old soul and voice of reason.\\n\\nI guess I just had an epiphany as to why she’s not committing to the person she’s seeing.\\n\\nThanks again!',\n",

According to some other article I read a while back, the recommendations that paper makes cover some 102 objects in the solar system, including Pluto. If memory serves, the technical explanation for reclassifying the moon is that the moon doesn't orbit the center of the earth, but orbits the point of gravitational equilibrium about 1000 miles below earth's surface. This means that it doesn't fit the precise definition of a moon, but the Earth-Moon system can't properly be called a two-planet system either.

You'll hit places where your cell phone will get no reception, and that sucks if it's your only form of navigation. This is less applicable if you have a dedicated GPS in your car, but it's still good practice to be able to read a road map. \\n\\nPack water in your car for long drives. Driving is thirsty work, and though it may not seem like it, you can absolutely get dehydrated behind the wheel. I usually take two gallon jugs or one of the 2.5 gallon ones with a tap and something smaller that can fit in a cupholder, either a bottle or a travel mug. When I stop for fuel, food, or just a stretch, I top up my smaller bottle out of the larger ones. Sub-protip: 2.5 gallon jugs don't equalize pressure efficiently, so the tap will slow to a trickle, take a big, sudden gasp of air, and then become a full stream again, which can lead to spillage if you're filling a bottle. To avoid this, poke a small hole in the top of the jug so that air can come in as the water empties. You may want to wait to do this until you've partially drained the jug so you don't get any water sloshing through the hole.\\n\\nIf you want a clean place to answer nature's call on the road and you aren't near a Buc-ee's, go to a hotel. They have lobby toilets and nobody really minds if you pop in to use it.

You *will* be paying $1-2 more per gallon in Ludlow, Needles, or Blythe (though Blythe isn't so bad as the other two) than you would a if you can make it to Barstow or Indio. When it doubt, fill up in Arizona, because gas prices are far lower. I have no idea if this advice applies to places further north, but I imagine it does.\\n\\nIf you're traveling down I-40, you're basically traveling Route 66, America's Mother Road.

Also- Nixon had a very dark, paranoid personality, and craved the validation of winning. He distrusted the mainstrean media, and felt a lot of hatred from the anti-war crowd. He had lost once before in a presidential election to John F. Kennedy in 1960 - and it nearly crushed him. He needed to win. He had to win. At all costs. He was obsessed with it. He thought maybe the Dems had dirt on him they could use to defeat him in \\'72. One possibility: (from the book \"Nixonland\") -  in 1967 (leading up to his presidential run in 1968) Nixon reportedly used his connections as former vice president to communicate via back channels to the North Vietnamese govt. NOT to make a peace deal with then Democratic President Lyndon Johnson. Nixon implied that if North Vietnam prolonged the war - it would help Nixon win the Republican nomination, and help him get elected president in \\'68 as the man who could end the war. In exchange, he would reward the North with a better peace deal than they would get from Johnson. Nixon did win the presidency promising \"Peace with Honor.\" Tens of thousands of American soldiers (and hundreds of thousands of North Vietnamese) died by prolonging the war. That\\'s how much he NEEDED to be elected president. He was willing to let American soldiers die to make sure he got elected. He was not a good human being. Nixon cared about Nixon.

I always wondered why any company I worked for during those years had ANY male employees when they could save 25% to 30% of their labor costs simply by hiring only women.

Practice doing a slash, rolling out of the way, sheathe, dodge a few more times, slash again, etc until you get a hang of its weak points and movement.

       "  'I think the focus on Malvern stems from the original conception of that area as something far more than it\\'s turned out to be. Don\\'t forget that Malvern was built (in the 70s and 80s) directly by the CMHC as a \"master-planned affordable community\"—it was anticipated as being a significant urban centre for residents and employment alike in the suburbs. The initial jobs projections for the area were pretty wild (something like 10,000+? I can\\'t find the source right now). You can even see in the road layout of the neighbourhood from the sky (the sort of \"spaghetti bowl\") that it was supposed to be iconic, and focused to a high-density node at Malvern Town Centre (in the Neilson-Tapscott-Sewells-McLevin area).\\n\\nOf course, Malvern hasn\\'t exactly turned out to be the burgeoning / thriving community it was slated to be. But if you took those plans to heart around the time the RT was being planned, with the abandoned Canadian Northern rail corridor heading northeast from STC anyways, it seemed like a natural fit to extend rapid transit to the area. Nowadays the arguments stem more from the large low-income population in Malvern which is more transit-reliant than most (but, due to the strongly suburban layout of the community, can face long walks to transit).\\n\\nJust wanted to add: the above has all just been a historical discussion. My preference would be for Malvern to get a GO-RER station on the CP rail corridor there as well, yes, along a future GO Midtown Line.',\n",

Rapid transit plans to serve their area—which was really intended to be a major employment node in the suburbs when it was first developed—have been thrown about at council since the 80s, if not earlier.\\n\\nIn fact, the Scarborough RT was initially intended to go straight through to Malvern Town Centre, which in my opinion would've made the most sense to do right off the bat when the line was constructed.\\n\\nIf you look on Google Maps you can even trace out the route that the RT would've taken to reach Malvern. East of McCowan Station it would've passed through what's today the McCowan Yard, then followed the angled corridor at the east end of the yard northeast to Progress Avenue. Crossing the 401 where Progress does now (with a stop at Centennial College) the RT would've passed the business park on Milner, over Sheppard, and followed the empty grass corridor behind the homes on Mammoth Hall Trail in Malvern to McLevin Avenue and Malvern Town Centre.\\n\\nAll in all, had the RT actually been built this far in the 80s, the maintenance and replacement issues we're facing today with it may have been greater, but a lot of important destinations in northeast Scarborough would've had a much better transit connection.\",\n",

Now whenever we played games I was always drawing the short end of the stick being the youngest sibling. That is just the role you have to play growing up.\\n\\n>The story begins one night when I was 6 years old. My sisters and I were watching a movie in the basement with a big bowl of poporn, and like the little kids we are, we have no attention span. Therefore part way through the movie we get distracted and we start playing games while the movie is playing. My sisters decided to choose the game and shortly after I found myself playing the role of a dog. A dog, you read that right. Now being the younger sibling I didn't really have much choice. So being me I played the best damn dog you'd ever seen. As we kept playing my eldest sister put some popcorn into a little bowl for me to eat. Being a dog, I have to eat with no hands. Now I find myself face first into a bowl of popcorn munching down. As I'm eating I'm breathing through my nose because my mouth is full of the buttery goodness. Now this is where the kernel comes into play. I breath in through my nose while I'm eating and to my surprise an unpopped popcorn kernel shoots into my nose (left side). Now I can feel the kernel, however, I can still breath through that side of my nose. Odd right? So I tell my sisters and they bring my to my parents to be inspected. My parents look in my nose and see nothing. Being concerned parents, they brought me to the doctors for him to check up my nose. Like my parents, the Doc sees nothing. Now I'm thinking, 'where the hell did this kernel go?'. After a few days the fuss goes away and I believe that there is no kernel in my nose. \\n\\n>The kernel got stuck into a little pocket inside my nasal passage that isn't visible.\\n\\n>Fast forward three months and I find myself sick with a head cold. So my mom is serving me lunch while I sit at the table and she notices I have a stuffy nose. As a kid, I hated blowing my nose, it freaked me out for some reason. So my mom brought over a tissue and she told me blow as she held the tissue. I blew my nose, one side at a time. After I blew the second side it made me need to sneeze, so my mom grabbed another tissue and covered my nose as I sneezed. Now let me tell you, this was one hard sneeze. The result, a wad of boogers that are green and brown in the tissue. My mom sees the tissue and looks at it in disgust as she folds it in half to throw away. As she does this she notices that there is something solid inside the tissue. She opens it up to inspect and to her amazement an unpopped popcorn kernel lies in the middle of the booger pile. Moments after the sneeze my nose started to bleed and I sat curiously in my chair with a tissue on my nose. Regardless, she took the kernel out and washed it off so that she could show the rest of my family later in the day. She then proceeds to examine it and notices something green sticking out of it. Still confused as to what she is seeing, she shows my dad when he gets home from work. He looks at it in shock, and points out that it looks like a root sticking out. Still dubious, they bring me and my kernel to the doctor the next day. Let me mention this now, throughout the remainder of the 'big sneeze' day, I had frequent nose bleeds that lasted around 5 minutes each which is why they brought me. He looks at the kernel and confirms that it is indeed a small root sticking out of the kernel. The doctor suggests that he cauterize my nose in order to stop the nose bleeds due to the root hooking on to a blood supply in my nose. He continues to explain that the warm and moist environment in my nose lead to the kernel thriving in my nasal cavity. I ended up getting my nose cauterized but it didn't help much. \\n\\n>To this day my nose is super sensitive to getting hit or dry air resulting in me having nose bleeds as a regular part of my week. TIFU by letting a kernel take refuge in my left nostril for 3 months.\\n\\n>TL;DR - I was eating popcorn with no hands and I accidentally snorted an unpopped popcorn kernel up my nose. 3 months later I sneezed the kernel out into a tissue. The kernel had a small, green root growing out if it. Now I get nose bleeds pretty regularly.\\n\\n>This is my first post, hope you guys enjoyed my childhood trauma!\\n\\n>Edited: Spelling.\\n\\n\",\n",

Discord's a service just like that, designed originally for gamers though now used by a large variety of people. Mainly it serves as a voice chat, but it has other functions such as file sharing, text chat, and supposedly screen sharing to come soon. It's a great piece of software and totally free. (If you're wondering where they get their money from, the company's a venture capital, and I think they got a couple million left, so for now there ought to be no selling of private information).

To do that head over to [Twitter](https://twitter.com) and make an account, and then go to [Periscope](https://periscope.tv). As they are part of Twitter my guess is that they're not swimming in gold (Twitter had to close Vine because it was bleeding money and got surpassed by Instagram in popularity) so I wouldn't trust them with my data.

Which he threw away.    \\n  \\nBut, Jon\\'s engagement is _portrayed_ as a horrible tactical decision. Ramsay preys upon his emotions, and Jon jeopardizes his entire army, thousands of lives, on the chance that he can save one. It\\'s illustrative of the character of Jon, and how much he values the family that doesn\\'t value him; illustrative of Ramsay, as a practiced manipulator, even if he\\'s not a military strategist; and illustrative of Sansa\\'s intelligence and experience, gained through having been passed from one sadistic manipulator to the next--Joffrey, Baelish, Ramsay.    \\nJon\\'s forces get slaughtered.  \\n\\nBut. To address your points in order:  \\nJon not using terrain, chalk up to inexperience in large-scale conflict.  \\nJon rushing in, covered above: he\\'s emotional. Not _excusable_, but understandable.  \\nHis army following: they had a tough choice to either let their commander die, or rush to protect him at great cost. Jon represents  the leadership of an incredibly fragile social rebellion; without him, the wildlings have no strong advocacy. The army would collapse, the movement would collapse, and the Long Night would come for all of them.  \\nWun Weg: you know what, I actually totally agree with you, I found that very frustrating also. No excuse or reasoning. Dude should have picked up a tree, he\\'d have been unstoppable and would have broken that shield line like nothin\\'. Or he should have thrown rocks. Or people. Anything, really.  \\nRamsay shooting his own men, I feel is totally understandable. Not the best tactics, since as discussed, he\\'s not a military tactician, but it demonstrates his distance from even those loyal to him; Ramsay is in service to Ramsay and no one else, and what he likes is pain and death. If he has the resources to kill his enemies by killing his own men, that\\'s an appealing option.  \\nLack of scouts: I can\\'t really offer expert opinion, I don\\'t know tactics in depth; but I would _think_ (but am not sure) that scouts play much less of a role _during_ the open field combat that ensued. They needed every man possible. As for Ramsay\\'s forces not having scouts (because surely they could spare it, and it\\'s in keeping with his \"hunter\" secondary facet to his character\\'s identity), I would think that simply the fact that the Knights of the Vale seem comprised entirely of cavalry precluded scouting efficacy. They rode up very suddenly and swiftly, or at least appeared to.    \\n  \\nLast point I\\'ll make: the thing about good tactics and strategy is that often, they\\'re _boring_ to an audience. We saw it with the Unsullied, and at the siege of of...damn, wherever, the Blackfish was holed up. Forgot the name of it. And the Lannisters drew up their forces in textbook formation this season. But clean tactics isn\\'t going to do much good against an overwhelming force (the Dothraki horde); and textbook strategy doesn\\'t survive the psychological and physical assault of a dragon.  \\nPoint being, there are examples of \"good tactics\" throughout the show, but they aren\\'t memorable.

Most commonly this is not on a single card or even with a single bank (this becomes important). They will tell you they can settle for 7,000$.\\n\\nTo start the process you must stop paying the credit card companies, this helps them claim hardship when negotiating. They also set up \"savings\" account for you. This account is not helps by a traditional bank nor is it insured in anyway and the settlement agency has access to it.\\n\\nThe account is used because you obviously are not capable of saving money and this will help so that when it\\'s time to pay the settlements you have the money available.\\n\\nSo at this point they are going to discuss the fees:\\n\\n* The savings account has a built in fee, usually a % of withdrawn amounts.\\n* There will be a startup fee, usually a % of your debt, but at least 250$\\n* There will be a settlement fee, usually a % of the amount saved per an account.\\n\\nYou will then need to authorize an ACH debit to pay the startup fee and make a deposit in the account. You also will agree to allow automatic debits to this account (but don\\'t worry it\\'s still your money, you can get it at anytime).\\n\\nTypically they will push for 2-3% as a fee: 500$.\\n\\nLet\\'s assume your lowest card is around 5,000$, this will be the first one they settle. They will shoot for a 25% settlement, so 1,250$. But before they start trying to negotiate, you are not to pay for 3 months, and they want there to be 15% of the 5,000$ in your account (750$).\\n\\nLet\\'s say that you\\'re paying 200$ a month. To get 750$ you have to pay for 4 months. All the while not paying any of your cards (because they told you not to). So that\\'s 4 months of late fees and 4 months of compounded interest, which let\\'s face it, you\\'re probably paying about 18% APR.\\n\\nNow even with all the increase in your balance, they still manage to settle for 1,250$. By now you actually owe about 5,200$ so the total savings is 3,950$. Usually there is an expiration on these negotiations. So you have 1,000$ in your account. To complete the settlement you\\'ll need to transfer an additional 368.50$ (250 for the settlement plus the settlement fee). But you also have to put in an additional 50$ to cover the withdraw fee.\\n\\nCongratulations, you just made 3,950$ in income. And the total cost to you was just under 1,400$. So you paid about 27% of the 5,200$ or 28% of the original debt.\\n\\nNow play this scenario out for all of your cards over a 5 year time period. While you\\'re trying to put money into an account every month, your credit cards are ballooning with interest and fees and your credit score is tanking.\\n\\nFor most in this situation 200$ a month is quite a bit too keep up with. It is doubtful they would be able to come up with an additional 400$ without slipping other bills or going the cash advance route.\\n\\nThat being said there is a flaw in this exact scenario, minimum monthly payments on 25,000$ would total closer to 600$/month. The settlement agency will try and get you to deposit at least 400$-500$ a month.',\n",

In vi, if I want to switch the order of these two arguments, I can just `ddp`. On the other hand, in the style you recommend I would have to do the same thing then replace `(` with `,` on the second line and `,` with `(` on the first, a more time-consuming operation.\\n\\nThis format isn't perfect, ideally more-data and end-of-data could be implied by newlines and indentation, but that implies whitespace-sensitive syntax which the Rust developers decided against.\",\n",

       "  \"Firstly, thank you so much for your long and thoughtful response. There seems to be a lot of animosity here and I appreciate not being dismissed outright. Ultimately we all want the same thing. We want healthy, happy citizens. We want people to have freedom and equality, we just disagree on the method to get there.\\n\\nI'll try and answer your points individually, but this is just my opinion, and I'm by no mean an expert.\\n\\n1: This really resonated with me, and made me think. At first I thought, is a person's right to be protected from serious trauma less valuable to me than one man's right not to wear a seatbelt? But then I realised, I don’t think that’s the question here. The risk of being a smear on the road is a far more compelling reason not to wear a seatbelt than the fear of a fine, and I believe in education over restriction. If a government wants to have people wear seatbelts, it needs to teach them why. And if enough people don't wear them, people will realise the consequences. If people are willing to forgo a seatbelt despite risk of DEATH, do you think a $150 fine would dissuade them? The only people I can see who wear a seatbelt only to avoid a fine are the uneducated poor who don't know/understand the risk but can't afford a fine. I believe the answer to that is education, not restriction.\\n\\nLet's look at smoking. No matter the taxes and gruesome pictures on the boxes, people still smoke. What HAS caused a reduction in smoking has been educating children in schools, telling them the truth, and being honest with them. One of the things I admire about NZ is the PSAs on TV against drunk driving that we are reddit-famous for. We didn't try to crack down on drunk driving the way the U.S. did on drugs, by throwing every teen who made a stupid decision in jail for the rest of their life. The government tried to educate instead.\\n\\nIn Germany a 16 year old can buy a beer with their McDonald's, but their drunk driving fatalies aren't through the roof. That's because the culture around drinking is very different from NZ. Ultimately social change comes from culture, not law. For gay people to get their right to marry in America, the culture had to shift to push for it first. But had the government not put the law in place already that gay people were not allowed to marry, no push had to be necessary. Same with segregation. The government didn’t put a stop to it, it started it. It was government officials keeping the laws in place, government workers putting up the “Whites Only” signs. In both these cases the government did not start social change, people did. And the government had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into progress.\\n\\n2: If you believe people are incurable assholes (and I agree, some are), why let those make laws? A government is made up of people after all. If some morons were telling transgender people they’re not allowed in bathrooms, they’d just be some assholes. What has made them an issue is that those morons are in office. You’re saying people need laws to protect them from themselves, while citing an example of people using the law TO discriminate. In many places, a majority of people believe transgender people can go to the bathroom, and gay people can marry. This did not use to be the case, but people changed and culture shifted. And over time, culture will shift in less progressive areas as well. The people lobbying against gay marriage or allowing transgender people to just go to the godamn bathroom are using the government to hold back progress. If the government was not involved at all, progress could not march on.\\n\\nAnd there are still laws against assaulting people in bathrooms, whether they’re being assaulted for being transgender or not. So trying to say the government should put a law in place that says you should allow people to use whichever bathroom they want, in order to prevent assault, is almost as nonsensical as saying we shouldn’t allow transgender people in bathrooms to prevent assault. Assault is ALREADY illegal.\\n\\n\\nSorry I don’t have time to answer your other points currently, but I will come back for them.\\n\",\n",

I have no problem separating people by how they behave on an individual basis and have never grouped people into categories like \"men do this\" or \"women do this\" or \"black people do this\" etc. I take each person for who they are and allow them to prove who they are through their character and actions, not a preconceived notion of how they should behave.\\n\\nYou\\'re mixing up multiple concepts. I never said I willfully ignore an individuals behavior, I said reasonable people can form reasonable generalizations about the world. \"Asian people are good at math\" is a reasonable generalization that has been explored by science and there are reasons for this. If you meet an asian person who\\'s bad at math, this person is likely a deviation. \\n\\nThese are not mutually exclusive concepts. \\n\\n>I just don\\'t agree with narrative on here of \"All women are like that\" when my experiences have proven otherwise. Are there women like the negative online stereotypes out there? Absolutely, just as there are men who are shitty and treat women like dirt. \\n\\n\\n>No. Most people are just trying to get through life and everyone has their share of issues that they have to deal with. Having a competition on who has it better or worse is silly.\\n\\nOn the contrary, being the sex who\\'s sexuality is active, it\\'s an incredibly important dynamic to realize that women, by and large, have it much easier, and function as a far more homogeneous group than men. There is probably no more important concept to grasp if you want to succeed with women in this day and age. \\n\\nLet\\'s be honest, people who say \"oppression olympics is silly!\" are usually not the people on the \\'oppression\\' side. You\\'d be singing a different tune if you were an ugly male \"incel\".  \\n\\n>Lol, everyone always says this, but I have had people act extremely mean to me online, even after finding out I was female. Nobody is tipping their fedoras at me and sucking up like they\\'re hoping to get laid. This is more like an internet joke than an actual thing that happens in practice. It\\'s not as if I care either way. I actually enjoy fighting online. But I always laugh when people act like women have a bunch of online orbiters. Nobody on reddit even knows the gender of who they\\'re talking to and most assume everyone is male as a default.\\n\\nThat seems to serve to prove my point though so I don\\'t get what you\\'re trying to say. The fact that you claim to not experience benevolent sexism online probably has more to do with the topics you choose to engage on, and the subreddits in question, and the nature of your conversations with people. Go post your shoulder to GoneWild if you want 1000 new inbox marriage proposals. \\n\\n>I\\'d rather have the gun. You can always turn and shoot the guy telling you what to do.\\n\\nMen and women are existentially linked, unless you\\'re gay. You can\\'t shoot the other person, they pay your bills... this is now a convoluted metaphor...the point was women are under the impression male hard power is the only power of value when female soft power is just as good, if not better. \\n\\n>See my earlier point on this. No, women actually get rejected from average guys. Most people dating are average people. Not everyone out there is chasing supermodels.\\n\\nThis ignores the entire scope of human sexuality and gender dynamics and as it would take a very long time to explain it all piece by piece, suffice to say that average women and average men doesn\\'t mean much. A 4/10 and a 6/10 are still average, but will lead massively different sexual lifestyles.\\n\\nThis also doesn\\'t invalidate the nature of human sexuality with women being the pickers and men being the performers.  \\n\\n>A lot of people are not on Tinder. Even with millions of users, it\\'s still a small chunk of the population. And yeah, if women just want to get fucked, they can find some dude who will do it.

Blueberry pie is not a living thing the way men, women, or people of different races or religions happen to be. There is a big difference between hating a food and hating another type of human being simply for being born something out of their own control.\\n\\nFair enough, but my real point was more that most people don\\'t have just no reason at all to dislike an entire group of people. Basic psychology; the human brain does not have the resources to micromanage the differences between every person ever. You meet a bunch of people and put them in boxes. More people, better boxes. A reasonable person can pretty accurately form reasonable boxes. Sure, if you\\'re a basement dwelling lv80 wizard, your boxes on just about everyone are going to be fucked up (hence, mass shooters). The problem I have with your logic is that your logic is backwards rationalized to make dislike any demographic unjustifiable, which in itself is unreasonable. You can criticize my box but it won\\'t help anything. You can\\'t shame the KKK into liking black people. You have to demonstrate why the box is wrong. \\n\\n>Again, a few vocal feminazis are not really what feminism is about. Original feminism was to give more attention to women\\'s rights and experiences in a search for equality. The fact that people have abused it does not change its original intention. There will always be extremists in any group.\\n\\nIt\\'s not about the feminazis. Feminism in 2018, ALL feminism is a social privilege advocacy group. The fact that it was a real movement for a real purpose in 1920-1950 doesn\\'t mean that\\'s still what it is today. Besides, I think you have already agreed that women are not unequal in the modern age anyways. I\\'d say except for female convicts getting radically lighter sentences, that\\'s mostly true as far as the laws are concerned. \\n\\n>I do believe that lived experiences are important, but the reason they are largely unreliable in an argument is because everyone has differemt experiences and perceptions. We could argue all day about this and get nowhere, because my own personal study of other people shows me the complete opposite of anything you\\'ve said. \\n\\nI think you\\'ve misunderstood my issue with \"sourcefagging\". I think the idea that studies are required before any conversation about any topic can take place in which two reasonable people can discuss what they believe to be true is ridiculous, especially on this topic (love, sex, romance) in which conducting difinitive studies is more or less impossible given the transient nature of emotions and lust, and people\\'s lack of understanding what they themselves even like or are attracted to. A group of people in a room with hundreds of social interactions, knowledge of culture and witnessings of many relationships can probably form a more accurate anecdotal understanding of human sex than any given study you can find online. \\n\\nI\\'m not trying to claim studies have no use, or do not assist us in knowing what is true and what is not true. I\\'m saying people\\'s infallible trust in studies and this new culture of pretending to know nothing about the world until a study tells you so is obnoxious. I read studies on a weekly basis that clearly aren\\'t true or are demonstrably flawed. \\n\\nAs per our experiences, those are filtered through our values. You as a woman may not pay any attention to how women as a collective treat men because it makes no difference to you. I, as a man, may have. Perhaps you even HAVE noticed x or y, but think they\\'re positive qualities, where as I as a man think they\\'re negative. People do this all the time. Reasonable people can admit their opinion may have a bias. \\n\\n>Women are clearly not valued by a large majority of people considering how rampant misogyny on the internet is\\n\\nI never understood how this argument made sense. Everyone is mean on the internet and men are much meaner to each other than users they know are women. \\n\\nIt also gives men who hate women a voice which they cannot use in real life because expressing dislike or even mild inconveniencing of women or female values is socio-economic suicide so the hate probably feels amplifies to you because the outside world is so sterile. \\n\\n>(who would want to degrade themselves like that anyways)\\n\\nEveryone who isn\\'t a woman it seems. \\n\\n>I work with and have plenty of male friends, and many of them are not \"high powered\" and certainly not wealthy, yet they still command respect for their ideas and they still have women bending over backwards to help them out. I have seen ebough women go out of their way to support men they admire or find attractive in some way to know that men also can use their own sexuality in the same manner should they choose to do so. The fact that nobody expects them to is the power that they hold.\\n>But women are not really sexual selectors. Women go through the same anxiety trying to get men as men do for women. My friends are often crying for being rejected, or going out of their way to try to impress a man in hopes that he notices them. I\\'d say both men and women play an equal part in choosing one another.\\n\\nAttraction is another thing. You apparently only hang out with attractive men (which somewhat  proves my points, but ignoring that for a moment) Sureare attracted to men revere them. That\\'s how female attraction works. The issue is women are hyper selective and consider most men pond-scum and men are supplicative and treat most women like idols. \\n\\nI think suggesting women want or are ok with this changing is not supported by reality. \\n\\n>Anyway, I don\\'t know about you, but I would rather be revered for my hardwork, intelligence, and being a self-made person than be handed things simply for flaunting my sexuality and having men take pity on me for being female. Equality to me means having no handicaps or advantages in any regard. I would not respect myself any other way. \\n\\nThe amount of women who say this and then complain about misogyny when they\\'re treated like men is pretty indicative that women have no real interest socio-economic equality. \\n\\nThe world of men is cold and unforgiving and I don\\'t think women are prepared to accept that it wasn\\'t misogyny, they just suck at their job. It wasn\\'t misogyny, being a mother rjust isn\\'t the hardest job in the world. It wasn\\'t misogyny, you\\'re just worth less than he is. It wasn\\'t misogyny, you just made a bad life choice. Etc... \\n\\n>Being able to get fucked by a bunch of people is not power in any real manner, and only leads to people seeing you as having less value\\n\\nBeing the person who tells the guy with the gun who to shoot is just as good, if not a better position to be in than the guy with the gun; you don\\'t even need the gun. \\n\\n>I certainly wouldn\\'t be able to play my instrument at the level that I do just from opening my legs. And even if I could, what would stop a hundred other women from doing the same? The only true measure of merit is to put in actual work.\\n\\nActually, if you work a skill based profession, like playing in an orchestra, you could get further faster by sleeping with people. Being actually good at it you can do for yourself anyway. It\\'s not mutually exclusive. \\n\\n>But women are not really sexual selectors. Women go through the same anxiety trying to get men as men do for women. My friends are often crying for being rejected, or going out of their way to try to impress a man in hopes that he notices them. I\\'d say both men and women play an equal part in choosing one another. \\n\\nSuper nope. Men perform. Women pick. You\\'re talking about the men women actively go for which are typically so attractive they have options and a given woman isn\\'t usually his best option hence the crying. That doesn\\'t mean I can open up tinder and have 300 matches in 15min. That doesn\\'t mean the struggle to find sexual partners or romantic partners is equal. It radically favours women. This is like a basic foundation of human gender dynamics and relationships. This is a basic building block of nature itself shared amongst most animals on earth. \\n\\n>Yeah, again, these are the kind of things a vocal minority of stupid women think and believe. These things are indicative of modern tinder culture which is mostly made up of immature women who have their egos inflated by desperate men looking for sex. Even if millions of people use these sites and spout this crap, it still only represents a minority of how real, mature people think and live their lives.\\n\\nWell Tinder is a cultural phenomenon that\\'s a symptom, not a cause. I think so-called \"tinder culture\" is the way of the modern young adult because that\\'s how our society works now, not because they\\'re young and immature and this is a phase.

No, it is stupid, and any person that blindly hates a whole group of people, men, women, or otherwise, doesn\\'t really deserve to be taken seriously.\\n\\nSomeone can dislike whomever they please for whatever reason they please. The only reason this is an issue is because we\\'re talking about women instead of blueberry pie. If I tried 1 blueberry pie, at 1 location, and declared all blueberry pie sucked, no one would care, nor would anyone even really consider that unreasonable.

Or any demographic...\\n\\nYou\\'re talking about people being written off, which is at odds with the topic you\\'re defending. Feminism most certainly doesn\\'t write these people off. The entire point of feminism is that these people are taken the most seriously and society should be restructured to remove their influence. \\n\\n>Your lived experiences aren\\'t really factual, peer-reviewed studies (and if they are, I\\'d love to see them). Those are your experiences, and mine have been the complete opposite. People are incredibly bad about experiencing confirmation bias.\\n\\nSure, not many people are good at being objective. I don\\'t disagree. \\n\\nThat being said, I\\'m going to throw out the obligatory \"studies don\\'t make things facts\" objection. Just because a guy in a labcoat said something doesn\\'t make it true. It doesn\\'t even make it close to true. Studies that were held up as the authority on topics are proved wrong or overturned on a fairly regular basis. \\n\\nLived experiences are one thing. Having a reasonable basis for your beliefs and being capable of defending those beliefs is another thing. Having a belief that is supported neither by observation (or bad observation) nor reasoning is a whole nother thing. \\n\\nI\\'m perfectly fine to accept people\\'s lived experiences provided they are reasonable and are not trying to overstep and aren\\'t obviously more indicative of a niche collection of people. That\\'s just me though. \\n\\n>Of the 98% of women you spoke to, what was their education level, background, and what was the context of the discussion? Also, how many women are you including in this sample size? I hardly doubt you have had a discussion with all 4 billion, or even more than a few thousand women.\\n\\nI\\'m not claiming I have spoken to all 4 billion women. I probably have debated near 1000 women on the topic, but nevertheless, that isn\\'t necessary. All that\\'s necessarily is an estimation as to whether the women that were spoken to were atypical of their demographic or not. Any reasonable person who lives in the west can form a pretty accurate understanding through media, culture, social overtones and lived experience as to the opinions and socio-political leanings of their fellow humans. Ie. I don\\'t need to interview everyone in Arizona to guess what most Arizonan\\'s opinion on abortion is. \\n\\n>Then you live in a different reality than I do. Women have to work much harder to gain the same respect that men do. Men are valued for their behavior and action where as women are usually regarded by their sexual market value. \\n\\nI disagree. I think you\\'re comparing apples to oranges. Men are valued for what they offer. Women are valued inherently for their existence. It is far more desirable to be a woman than to be an unimpressive man. Unless you are a more impressive man than Gal Gadot is hot, it\\'s a better deal to be a woman in 2018. High value men are impressive because they had to work a lot harder to get there; it is easy to be successful when you started life 2 laps ahead and 50% of the people you met were invested in staying on your good side in the hopes of having sex with you. \\n\\nNot many people respect successful people who only became more successful regardless of gender (ie. Trump, most US politicians, etc.)\\n\\n>If you think a few free drinks and meals here and there are akin to having more privilege, then you and I have very different definitions of privilege. People wanting to fuck you isn\\'t something to be proud of nor does it translate to having any real power beyond what you offer in bed. \\n\\nI think you radically underestimate the social benefits involved in preferential social treatment. Women have a mental block around soft power. They seem to believe hard power is the only real power. The fact that I have a greater chance of being a CEO isn\\'t a privilege, or if it is, it\\'s insignificant next to women having infinite access to sexual partners, women being the beneficiaries of benevolent sexism and affirmative action. The adult industry making female homelessness an impossibility. The fact that questioning a woman\\'s claim (#MeToo) or attacking women back is viewed as socially intolerable. Female criminals getting radically lighter sentencing. Hell, even just going back to your original example, I know lots of women who don\\'t take their purses or wallets with them when they go out on friday because it\\'s easier just to get men to buy things for them than risk their wallet being stolen or spend money. Having your entertainment paid for you as an expense is a far more significant daily privilege than the *possibility* of being respected more *if* I\\'m already successful. Beyond that men really get nothing. Hell, just the fact that women are the sexual selector and thus command the deference of most men in their surroundings is a far greater privilege than any other demographic experiences...\\n\\nThis idea that the guy with the gun has more power than the guy who tells him who to shoot is a VERY female solipsist worldview. And ironically, very feminist for someone who claims not to be an ardent supporter. \\n\\n>Once a woman loses her youth and beauty, she is treated no better than any other. Men may regard women with more kindness than other men, but that doesn\\'t always translate to having things handed to you. Plenty of women work very hard for what they have and where they end up. I know that I have personally earned everything I have done and that I work just as hard, if not more so, than many of the men in my life.\\n\\nI\\'m not saying women can\\'t work hard, I\\'m saying women don\\'t need to work hard. You probably could have achieved most of what you\\'ve achieved simply by sleeping with the right people if you were so inclined. You could probably achieve more than I will ever achieve at maximum effort simply by sleeping with the right people. \\n\\nI can\\'t do that. I have to actually work and not only work, but also work well, and be intelligent. \\n\\n>Right, and that is why women continue to espouse feminism, because they value having rights and do not wish to stand back and have them taken away. It\\'s frightening when so many people wish to hold people back for their genitals with no fair chance to demonstrate their capability to handle certain responsibilities. If respect must be earned, then everyone deserves a fair shot to earn it until they\\'ve proven themselves incapable. The general public should never represent the individual, just as the fat tumblr feminist who screams about harrassment should not represent women\\'s thoughts and behaviors regarding issues of equality.\\n\\nMaybe but that\\'s not how people work.

I actually like it more than Mercer\\'s Blood Hunter in how it seems to present itself as something that fits in with the rest of 5e and doesn\\'t feature mechanics that have weird interactions with others. I\\'m going to list off all of the things that I\\'ve spotted that might give me pause or somehow sticks out in no particular order.\\n\\n* Sanguine spells: Most of these fit really well with the theme you have going on and pack some punch. However, might I suggest *hold monster* in place of *enervation*? This is partly to do with the \"i hunt monsters relentlessly\" shtick, and partly because I don\\'t think enervation is a good spell ¯\\\\\\\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\\n\\n* The Channel Vitality\\'s Infusion is cool and thematic, but it\\'s an action and only does 1d4 extra damage until 11th level, even if you can make an attack with it you might be better off casting *hunter\\'s mark* in most situations. Looking at the elemental damage, every elemental type on that list gets a nice boon from *elemental bane* except necrotic, which sticks out.\\n\\n* Channel Divinity: Malediction offers diminishing returns as you level up for lower level spells. At 13th level, why would you sacrifice 26 HP to cast *bane* when you can get *elemental bane* for the same HP cost? Maybe consider altering the hit points sacrificed to vary depending on the spell cast. As an aside, when it says \"You can\\'t regain a use again until you finish a long rest.\" does this mean that once you sacrifice HP you\\'re locked out until you long rest or can you use it without sacrificing HP after a short rest?\\n\\n* Desperate Struggle is a nice ability, but it seems like the temp HP you get should be based on spell level. Also, should the temporary hit points last until you long rest like most sources of temp HP?\\n\\n* Sacrifice Vitality: Lethal Infusion is a nice upgrade. I assume that the extra attacking benefit is only supposed to happen if you take your level\\'s worth of necrotic damage and not twice your level\\'s worth of necrotic damage from using Channel Vitality after expending its use?\\n\\n* Sacrifice Vitality: Maledict Terror\\'s frighten seems to be at odds with *hold person*, *enervation* and partially *bestow curse*, having the fear effect either not really matter in the case of *hold person* and actually work against you in the case of *enervation*, as the target will be more inclined to leave its area of effect or seek cover from you.\\n\\n* Rite of Pain seems kinda nuts when used in conjunction with your other self-damaging abilities, seeing as how you can take as little as 1 damage from anything and target whatever\\'s in range, on top of being at-will. Perhaps consider limiting its use to X/rest?\\n\\n* Edit: I know it\\'s not mandatory for rangers, but I can\\'t help but feel that there\\'s something exploration or social interaction based that could gel really well in this class. Maybe like an X/rest feature that lets you identify whether or not a creature is poisoned/diseased/charmed/affected by magic.\\n\\nDespite the longish critique, I think you\\'ve got something really cool here, and I\\'d like to see where it goes!',\n",

There's also certain features (the radiant rite damage comes to mind immediately, and some of the mutagen concoctions.

I need to rewrite this feature, as by RAW *friends* doesn't actually charm the target, but still gives you advantage on Charisma checks to interact with them.\\n\\nYour suggestion about Black Will is intriguing! I agree that it seems rather lackluster compared to, say, the UA Ancestral Guardian's 10th level ability where they can cast clairvoyance once per rest. That being said, none of the other barbarian paths offer a direct combat advantage for their 10th level abilities, and I'd like to model this path after the official material.
